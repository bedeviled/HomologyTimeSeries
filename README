build time-dependent homology bar graph for time slices of an entire network.  Try to do change detection.  Probable negative outcome: hard to detect structural changeâ€¦ too wiggly.  Secondarily we can add persistence to the picture.  The first question to ask there is: what is the correct notion of persistence.  Ideas include: inclusion of flow in time window around, inclusion of flow in entropy window, inclusion of flow in  port window.

on hiatus for future: break the graphs in pieces.

subproblem: can we embed the network in a space in a reasonable way? what does this gain us?

Hypothesis: choosing carefully what your faces and dimension of said faces are for your graph can have analytic impact.  It certainly has topological consequences.  You have a collection of points.  How you decide to connect those points will affect your answer.  What is the correct way to interpret these points as a geometric object.

possible approach: perform the above homology statistics on a filtration over the dimension of the max simplex dimension.
